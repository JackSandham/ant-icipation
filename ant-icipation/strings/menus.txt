# Lines beginning with a #, space or new line character are not loaded.
# Formatting a string:
# - Use a key and value pair.
# - A key ends at the first space character
# - A value ends at the first new line character after the key
# - Whitespace is trimmed from the value up to the first non space character
# - Use the ` symbol to place a new line character in to your string.
# Example:
# my_test_key              my value
# Loads as:
# my_test_key my value
